                            <h2><a href="">Why Practice Law?</a></h2>
                            <p>
                                <img title="Law" src="Images/lawschool.jpg" />
                    
                            </p> 
                            <p>I have dreamed of practicing law since I was 8 years old, that's not an exaggeration either. When I was 8 I got a 100% on a quiz about the constitution and my teacher told me that I might be a lawyer one day when I grow up, so I just ran with that idea.</p>
                            <p>As I grew up, the reason for why I wanted to practice law would change, and the type of law I would like to practice would change, but the desire to be a lawyer remained constant. When I was in middle school and my first few years of high school I wanted to be a corporate lawyer who would make a lot of money and have a big house and a lot of other materialistic posessions.</p>
                            <p> However, when I reached my senior year of high school one of my teachers made me confront a lot of the darker sides of practicing law. She was a retired corporate lawyer, and she helped to illustrate a lot of the more morally disgusting aspects of law that existed within that area of law. She wasn't trying to get me to not go into law for my career, but the way she phrased it was that she believed I wouldn't let go of my morals for the sake of a paycheck.</p>

                            <p> She was definitely right about that, so I changed my focus. I still am going to practice law, but I want to become a prosecutor and work with the state to enforce the laws of our society. I think that this will allow me access to the system so that I can get a better understanding of how the system works, so that I may one day make lasting change. I believe our justice system has many flaws that are exploited, and that many people are not properly protected under these systems, my dream is to fix those issues. Hopefully one day I can.</p>

                            <h2><a href="">Denver University</a></h2>
                           <p>During the fall semester of 2021, I applied to over a dozen law schools and was accepted to a little over half of them. Including but not limited to Suffolk University in Boston, Albany University in Albany, Hofstra University in Long Island, and Denver University in Denver Colorado.</p>
                            <p> After receiving my decisions I set out to visit many of the schools I applied to, in order to make a more informed decision before I committed to any one of these schools. Before I toured Denver, I took a roadtrip with my closest friends to see Albany University and Suffolk University.</p>

                            <p>

                            </p>

                           <p> During our road trip we drove from Binghamton New York, to Albany New York, to Syracuse New York and then to Boston with a few stops. I drove both ways the entire time, the small blizzard we were driving through during the day of our departure didn't help my bad driving at all.</p>
                           <p>

                            </p>

                            
                            
                            <p> During spring break of my senior year I traveled by myself to Colorado to tour Denver University. During my time there I was able to sit in on a class and was enthralled by how passionately the lecturer spoke. To be very honest the material was boring, and I was confused as I had no context for what they were learning, but the passion and care from the lectruer drew me in and sold me on the school.</p>

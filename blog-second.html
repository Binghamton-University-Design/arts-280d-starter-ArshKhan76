                            <p>During my trip to Colorado over spring break, I had scheduled many tours with different apartment complexes so that if I did choose to attended Denver University I would have some idea for housing once I moved. This process taught me two things, first that not all apartments were created equal, and second that Denver is expensive.</p>
                            <p> I toured over a dozen apartments over the 3 days I had free during my trip, across a variety of prices, locations, sizes, ameneties and many other factors. I toured an apartment that was over $2,500 a month for less than 400 square feet in a studio, and another that was a decent 700 square foot apartment for roughly $1,000 a month, unfortunately it had way more issues than the low price could make up for.</p>

                            <p>
                                <img title="Floorplan" src="Images/floorplan.jpg" />
                                <span class="caption">The rendered floor plan provided from their website</span>
                            
                            </p>

                            <p> Eventually I settled on this one bedroom apartment at Elevation at County Line Station. Providing a good balance of price to amenities, I get things like a dishwasher and in-unit washer dryer units, while also still being able to afford necessities like groceries. I am set to move the second week of July and can't wait to see what life out in Denver Colorado will be like!</p>
